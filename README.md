<h1>Analyzing House Sales in Russia: A Comprehensive Data-Driven Approach</h1>

<p>The Russian real estate market is vast and complex, with properties varying significantly in price based on location, type, and various other factors.</p>
<p></p>To gain deeper insights into this market, we conducted an extensive analysis of house sales data across Russia. </p>
This article outlines the steps taken, methodologies used, and key findings from the project.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p></p>The primary goal of this project was to analyze house sales data to understand the factors that influence property prices in Russia.</p>
The analysis involved several stages: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The dataset used for this project includes detailed records of house sales, encompassing attributes such as:</p>

<p><b>Date</b>: The publication date of the announcement.</p>
<p><b>Time</b>: The time when the ad was published.</p>
<p><b>Geo_lat and Geo_lon</b>: Latitude and longitude coordinates of the property.</p>
<p><b>Region</b>: The region of Russia where the property is located.</p>
<p><b>Building_type</b>: The type of building facade (e.g., Panel, Monolithic, Brick, Blocky, Wooden).</p>
<p><b>Object_type</b>: The type of apartment (Secondary real estate market or New building).</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: The floor level of the apartment.</p>
<p><b>Levels</b>: The total number of storeys in the building.</p>
<p><b>Rooms</b>: The number of living rooms.</p>
<p><b>Area</b>: The total area of the apartment.</p>
<p><b>Kitchen_area</b>: The area of the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Price</b>: The price of the property in rubles.</p>
  
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>1. Data Cleaning</h3>
The first step was to ensure the dataset was clean and consistent.
<p>This involved:</p>

<p><b>Handling Missing Values</b>: Filling or removing missing values where necessary.</p>
<p><b>Correcting Data Types</b>: Ensuring all columns had the appropriate data types for analysis.</p>
<p><b>Removing Duplicates</b>: Eliminating any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.</p>
<h3>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
<p>Key steps included:</p>

<p><b>Summary Statistics</b>: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistics to get an overview of the data.</p>
<p><b>Correlation Analysis</b>: Identifying correlations between different attributes to understand their relationships.</p>
<h3>3. Data Visualization</h3>
Visualization was crucial in uncovering patterns and trends in the data.
<p>We used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various plots:</p>

<p><b>Histograms</b>: To show the distribution of prices, areas, and other numerical variables.</p>
<p><b>Scatter Plots</b>: To visualize relationships between price and other variables such as area and number of rooms.</p>
<p><b>Heatmaps</b>: To display correlations between different variables.</p>
<h3>4. Predictive Modeling</h3>
To predict house prices based on various attributes, we built several models:

<p><b>Linear Regression</b>: To understand the linear relationship between price and other variables.</p>
<p><b>Random Forest</b>: To capture more complex, non-linear relationships.</p>
<p><b>Gradient Boosting</b>: For improved predictive performance by combining multiple weak models.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis yielded several key insights:</p>

<p><b>Geographic Influence</b>: House prices show significant regional variation.</p>
Properties in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg are priced higher compared to those in rural areas.
<p><b>Building Type</b>: Properties in monolithic and brick buildings tend to be more expensive than those in panel or wooden buildings.</p>
<p><b>Apartment Type</b>: New buildings generally command higher prices compared to those in the secondary market.</p>
<p><b>Floor Level and Storeys</b>: Apartments on higher floors in multi-storey buildings often have different pricing dynamics compared to those on lower floors.</p>
<p><b>Area and Rooms</b>: Larger apartments and those with more rooms are typically more expensive.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the Russian housing market, highlighting the key factors that influence property prices.</P>
<p>The insights gained can help buyers make informed decisions, sellers price their properties competitively, and policymakers understand market dynamics.</p>
Our predictive models also offer a tool for estimating property prices based on various attributes
